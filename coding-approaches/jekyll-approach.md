# Jekyll Approach

Finished self-hosted [website](https://katherinemichel.github.io/self-hosted-church-website-jekyll) and [code](https://github.com/KatherineMichel/self-hosted-church-website-jekyll/tree/gh-pages)<br>
Compare to the original [Squarespace website](http://www.prettyprairieumc.org)

## Background

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a web development framework created at [GitHub](https://github.com), the most popular place in the world for hosting open-source code. Jekyll sites can be hosted for free at GitHub and many individuals and organizations on GitHub use it as a convenient way to introduce themselves. Jekyll is user friendly, combining powerful web development features with free, easy deployment. However, Jekyll is a static framework that does not offer all traditional web development functionality. Whether it is right for a specific project needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. 
 
## Jekyll Pros and Cons

Pros
* Can be hosted for free at GitHub (can also be hosted elsewhere, but probably not for free)
* Many Jekyll code-bases exist on GitHub to learn from
* Fairly easy to deploy
* Can use a custom domain

Cons
* Static framework (as opposted to dynamic)
* Limited functionality
* Example websites tend to be simple, personal blogs, not professional quality websites
* Limited staged deployment

## Cost Comparison

Squarespace website
* $144/year basic, custom domain included
* Cost of labor, if any

Jekyll Site
* [Can be hosted for free at GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages)
* Cost of domain (~$10)
* Cost of labor, if any

## Tools Needed for This Project

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
* [Start Bookstrap Unstyled Starter Templates](http://startbootstrap.com/template-categories/unstyled)
* [GitHub](https://github.com) personal or organization account, in order to use GitHub gh-pages
* Optional: CNAME file (for custom domain)
* Optional: [Disqus](https://disqus.com) (for blog post comments)

## Staged Deployment

In a mission critical, live production environment, a website may be updated and viewed locally (on an individual computer), before the new code is pushed to the web host and viewed on a live staging site that is virtually the same as the live production site. If the result on the staging site is satisfactory, the change may be pushed to the live site where it will be seen by users. It is assumed that a website made using the approach given in this GitBook will be simple/low traffic enough that major updates could be verified locally and pushed directly to gh-pages. Minor changes, such as adding a blog post, could be completedly directly in GitHub via the browser. However, it is possible that a staging site could be created by making a staging branch, and merging the staging branch with the gh-pages branch. 

## Administration

GitHub can be used in two primary ways: through a personal account or an organization account. Any person making updates to the site will need to have a personal GitHub account. If the code-base is hosted in a GitHub organization account, any person who needs to have website admin privileges will need to be a member of the organization account. Anyone can submit a contribution to a code-base (this is called a pull request), but the account owner or an organization member will need to review the contribution to decide whether to merge it with the code-base or reject it. Unsolicited code contributions are not likely to occur on a small project. 

Though GitHub could looking intimidating at first, it can actually be simple to use. It is expected that the majority of the website will remain largely unchanged. Changes made by non-developers will be isolated. For example, a part of the website that would be updated often would be the blog. Updating the blog is not any more difficult than creating a word document, writing some text and saving it. 

Here are the steps for a person who is an account owner or organization member: 

In GitHub, navigate to the website repo and double click the name

For a non-root gh-pages repo (does not end in github.io) choose the gh-pages branch

Click on the _posts folder to open it

Click on the "post-template.markdown" file to open it
![](images/blog-posts.jpg)

Select all, copy the contents of the post template (Control-C), then click "Cancel"; Alternatively, click "Raw", select all, (Control-C), then back button

Click the "Create new file" button in the upper right

A new file will open

Paste the contents of the blog post template into the new file
![](images/paste-into-new-file.jpg)

In the "Name your file" box, type the yyyy-mm-dd-blog-post-title.markdown in exactly this format (exclude other punctuation such as apostrophes). In the body of the file, replace the generic "Front matter" with the information for this blog post (for example: title); Under the "Front matter," type or copy and paste your blog post text. If you do compose your post directly in the file, keep in mind that you may want to copy and save the body before clicking "Commit new file" so that if the browser has a connection error, your work is not lost.

When you are happy with your post, scroll to the bottom of the page. Optionally, leave a commit message. Click the green "Commit new file" button

The post will automatically populate a blog post description on the blog homepage with a link to an automatically populated blog post page
