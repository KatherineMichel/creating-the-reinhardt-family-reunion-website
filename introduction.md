# Introduction

I became aware of the Reinhardt Reunion Facebook group in 2016 when my mother unexpectedly crossed paths with a distant relative who is a fellow descendent of Henry and Elizabeth Reinhardt. My great-grandmother Alvina Reinhardt-Michel was the daughter of Henry and Elizabeth, and the mother of Leon Michel, my paternal grandfather. While I was growing up, I often heard it be said on my dad's side of the family that we are German and Russian. I did not fully understand what this meant, until several years ago, while looking for a long lost relative, I stumbled across a site containing geneological information meticulously collected and organized by professor Brent Mai of the Center for Volga German Studies. Because Brent and I share common relatives, much of the information Brent Mai has collected also applies to me and my family. Many of my ancestors on my dad's side of the family originated from Germany, but moved to Russia as part of a colonization effort promoted by Catherine the Great. The effort went sour and many of these [Volga Russians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volga_Germans), including my ancestors, left Russia for the U.S., to settle in states such as Kansas.
