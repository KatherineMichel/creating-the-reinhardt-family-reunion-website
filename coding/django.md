# Django

## Abstraction

One downside of using the CSS/HTML/JavaScript from a WordPress theme is that a few bits of code were not easy to abstract into a single template. 

## URLs

Navbar
* Template as a View (no view needed in views.py; template is rendered as is)

## Models

## Views

## Special Functionality

* Admin
* Tagging (I used django taggit)
* Pagination
