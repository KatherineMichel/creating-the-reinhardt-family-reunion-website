# Design

The website design is based on CSS/HTML/JavaScript that I extracted from a WordPress theme called Modern by WebMan. This freed me up to focus on the back-end functionality, which I wrote in Django. Though using a WordPress template in a Django website may seem unconventional, I randomly came across the theme after I had begun to work on the website in Django and loved the design. I felt it would fit very well for a genealogy website. The theme is black and white, with a touch of color.
