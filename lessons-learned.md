# Lessons Learned

* One downside of using the CSS/HTML/JavaScript from a WordPress theme is that the theme was very detailed, including pages with lengthy code and minor variations throughout. As a result, a few bits of code were not easy to abstract into individual code blocks. I ended up abstracting less code than I would have preferred, causing the code to be less "clean."
* Another downside of using the CSS/HTML/JavaScript from a WordPress theme is that many of the files I started out with were accessed via links to the theme author's site. I methodically copied these files into my website files and reconfigured the paths so that my site would not be dependent upon the author's site to properly render.
