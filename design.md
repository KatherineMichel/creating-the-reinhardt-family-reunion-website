# Design

## Theme

The website design is based on CSS/HTML/JavaScript that I extracted from a WordPress theme called Modern by WebMan. Though using a WordPress template in a non-WordPress website may seem unconventional, I randomly came across the theme and loved the design. I felt it would work very well for a genealogy website. The back-end is Jekyll.
