# Open-Source GitHub Organization

[GitHub](https://github.com) is the most popular place in the world for hosting open-source code. GitHub is a website built on top of the version control system Git. Linus Torvalds, the founder of Linux, a highly successful open-source operating system, created Git for his own use as the head maintainer of Linux, to coordinate contributions from developers around the world. Git by itself is not exactly user friendly. GitHub is a dashboard for Git, as well as a collaborative environment for open-source developers. Anyone can create a GitHub "repo" and store code there. If the repo is public, anyone can look through, learn from, and contribute to the code. 

Although GitHub is most often used by developers, increasingly more community organizations are using it to make their code open-source. Even a church could create a GitHub organization account, where a few people could access website code to make simple updates, such as publishing a new blog post. There is more about this topic in the Jekyll Approach section. 

Below are screenshots showing what a church GitHub organization would look like and the setup process.
